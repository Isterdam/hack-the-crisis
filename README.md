### Why?

Limiting and evenly distributing the number of customers visiting a store during a day is a key issue in fighting the spread of the coronavirus. 

### How?
In light of new government restrictions and guidelines regarding this topic, we present a booking system aimed at helping stores limit the number of customers as well as preventing long queues outside of stores - especially at peak hours.

A booking system for entry to a store will provide three important things:
* The flow of customers will be more spread out throughout the day
* Short queues, all the way down to no queues at all
* A simple way for stores to follow existing as well as possible future guidelines and regulations from the government
